# Newton's Method
A Newton’s method is the  fastest method for finding root. This method works by using first derivative of f(x) and an initial root estimation `x`. Therefore, this method require analytical process to determination first derivative of f(x). The root estimation (x) can be calculated by using

![newton equation](https://i.upmath.me/svg/x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%20%3D%20x_n%20-%20%7Bf(x)%5Cover%20f'(x)%7D)

By using this method, the root estimation can be convergence or not convergence. If the root estimation is convergence that means it is close to the expected root of f(x). Otherwise, if the root estimation is not convergence that means it is far to the expected root of f(x), so you have to input another initial root estimation again.

# Example
Given a function of f(x) = x2-2x+1. By using Newton’s Method, set initial root estimation (x) equal to 3. We then get the final root is 1.00024414 (precision in Fortran) by using Newton’s Method, where the f(x) is 0 and convergence to expected root of 1.
